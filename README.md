## Usage

Every method developed in **NAQRA** follows a structured naming convention with three parts, separated by underscores:

1. **Function**: Describes the primary operation or behavior of the method.
2. **Input(s)**: Specifies the type or nature of the inputs.
3. **Output**: Indicates the type or nature of the resulting output.

Non-trivial methods are documented directly within the code for clarity and ease of use.
